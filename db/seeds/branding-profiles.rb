                         "<p>How can I reach you guys?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>You can get in touch with our team through the website, chat or <a href=\"mailto:info@getcoveredinsurance.com\">email</a>. </p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>Is my information kept confidential? </p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Your privacy is highly valuable to us.

Note, we will share certain personal information (name, address, or phone number) with our partners and        providers in order to run our service and to resolve an incident, such as a water leak.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>Is Get Covered an insurance agency?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Yes we are!</p></li>    </ol>  </li>\n" +

                         "<ol class=\"faq-question\">  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>What is renters insurance? </p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Renter’s Insurance is property insurance that provides coverage for a policyholder's belongings,        liabilities and possibly living expenses in case of a loss event. This could be your personal belongings against        outside elements, i.e. fire, smoke, theft, water damage and explosion.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>What is a deductible?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>A deductible is the amount of money you’ll pay for losses or damages, before your insurance company steps        in and reimburses you.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>Do I need renter’s insurance even if my landlord has insurance? </p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Yes. Although your landlord carries coverage for the apartment building itself, there is no coverage for        your personal belongings. Further, in the event you cause damage to your apartment unit or other apartment        property, you will be financially obligated to reimburse the property for those damage repairs. Covering your        personal belongings is your responsibility.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>What is liability protection?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Liability Protection is a type of coverage that may help protect you from paying out of pocket for certain        costs if you are found legally responsible for injuries to other people or damage to their property. Liability        insurance policies cover both legal costs and any payouts for which the insured party would be responsible if        found legally liable. Intentional damage and contractual liabilities are generally not covered in these types of        policies.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>What if I don't have much personal property? </p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Renters insurance is still important even if you don't have much personal property because of the liability        component. Also, chances are your personal property is worth more than you think. If you don't have much        personal property to insure, then you can save money by choosing a lower policy limit.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>What is the difference between Liability Insurance and Content Insurance?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Personal Liability Coverage: Liability coverage protects you in the event of negligent damage that you may        cause to the property. </p></li>      <li><p>Contents Coverage: When your personal belongings are damaged or stolen your policy contents coverage        reimburses you up to your policy terms and limits.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>\n" +
                         "<p>As a renter, how much coverage do I need?</p>    <ol class=\"faq-answer\">      <li><p>Your building will most likely have a set minimum policy requirement Your policy limits for coverage should        be determined by the value of your personal property. If you live alone, $10,000 is a good starting point. If        you own jewelry items that are worth more than a $1,000 per item, let us know and we will be happy to provide a        quote for their addition. For couples, we suggest starting with $20,000 - $40,000 coverage.</p></li>    </ol>  </li>\n" +

You can edit the type of coverage and settings you want such as coverage limits, deductible and start and end        dates.
