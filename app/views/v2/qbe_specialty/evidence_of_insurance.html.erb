                <p>Coverages available to Tenant are summarized below. This Notice and Evidence of Insurance is not
                    an insurance policy.  It does not affirmatively or negatively amend, extend or alter the coverage
                    afforded by the Policy. Tenant is encouraged to review the Policy which sets forth all applicable
                    terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. Coverage may be narrower than a traditional
                    renter’s insurance policy.</p>

                <p><strong>Tenant’s Personal Property Endorsement (the “Personal Property Endorsement”):  This coverage
                    is provided only if “Yes” is indicated next to Tenant’s Personal Property Coverage in the Tenant
                    Schedule set forth above.</strong></p>

                <p>The contents coverage offered to the Tenant under the Personal Property Endorsement provides protection
                    for Tenant’s belongings extending to specific named perils (including Burglary) subject to the terms
                    of the Policy and the Personal Property Endorsement. Tenant is not the Named Insured under the Policy,
                    but is an insured under the Personal Property Endorsement to the extent of Tenant’s ownership interest
                    in property insured hereunder. This contents coverage is subject to the aggregate limit of the Tenant’s
                    Personal Property Endorsement which may limit the availability of such coverage or reduce the stated per
                    claim contents limit.</p>

                <p><strong>Deductible:</strong> $500 per claim.</p>

                <p><strong>Notice:</strong> After a loss, Tenant is responsible for giving prompt notice to the Insurer
                    (see Claim Submission information set forth above) with details of the loss, notifying the police if
                    a law has been broken, and protecting their property from any further damage, as provided in the
                    Personal Property Endorsement.</p>

                <p>In the event of a loss, the insurance carrier may require proof of Tenant’s ownership of covered contents.
                    Receipts and/or photographs can be satisfactory and can expedite the claims process. We recommend that
                    Tenants take an inventory of and photograph all personal possessions and store the documentation in a
                    secure location.</p>

                <p>The premises liability coverage offered to the Tenant under the Premises Liability Endorsement provides
                    the Tenant with Premises Liability coverage for “bodily injury” or “property damage” caused by an
                    “occurrence”, and coverage for Medical Payments to Others as defined in the Premises Liability Endorsement.
                    Tenant is not the Named Insured under the Policy, but is an insured under the Premises Liability Endorsement
                    to the extent of Tenant’s maintenance or use of the “residence premises”. This premises liability
                    coverage is subject to the aggregate limit of the Tenant’s Premises Liability Coverage Endorsement
                    which may limit the availability of such coverage or reduce the stated per occurrence liability limit.</p>

                <p><strong>Deductible:</strong> No deductible applies to this coverage.</p>
